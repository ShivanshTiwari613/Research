Introduction:
Here's a clean, formatted summary of the key information about coronary artery disease (CAD):

Overview:
- CAD is the most common form of heart disease and leading cause of death in the US and worldwide
- Characterized by atherosclerotic plaque buildup in coronary arteries that reduces blood flow to the heart muscle
- Results in inadequate oxygen delivery to the myocardium

Key Risk Factors:

Non-modifiable:
- Age
- Gender (men at higher risk)
- Family history
- Genetics/ethnicity

Modifiable:
- Hypertension 
- High cholesterol
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Smoking
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Poor diet
- Stress

Pathophysiology:
- Begins with chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction
- Plaque forms from buildup of fatty deposits, inflammatory cells, and calcium
- Arterial wall thickens and narrows, reducing blood flow
- Can lead to complete blockage if plaque ruptures and forms clot

Clinical Presentation:
- Can be asymptomatic
- Stable angina (chest pain with exertion)
- Acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, heart attack)
- Typical symptoms: chest pressure/pain, shortness of breath, fatigue
- Women may have more atypical symptoms

Prevention and Treatment:
- Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, smoking cessation)
- Blood pressure and cholesterol management
- Diabetes control
- Medications (statins, antiplatelets, beta blockers)
- Procedures if needed (stents, bypass surgery)
- Regular screening and risk assessment
- Patient education and interprofessional team care

The focus is increasingly on prevention through risk factor modification and early intervention. Outcomes have improved in developed countries due to better preventive care, but CAD remains a major public health challenge requiring ongoing attention to risk reduction strategies.

Literature Review:
Here's a formatted summary combining the key information from those sources about coronary artery disease (CAD):

Key Points:
- CAD is the leading cause of mortality in the United States, accounting for approximately 610,000 deaths annually (1 in 4 deaths) and is the third leading cause of mortality worldwide.

Risk Factors:
Non-modifiable:
- Age, gender, ethnicity, and family history
- These factors account for 63-80% of predictive performance

Modifiable:
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia 
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Smoking
- Poor diet
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Stress

Biomarkers and Diagnosis:
Traditional:
- Cardiac troponins (cTn) - gold standard but can give false positives
- High-sensitivity C-reactive protein
- Inflammatory cytokines

Emerging:
- Exosomes show promise as novel biomarkers
- Can be detected earlier than traditional markers
- Contain valuable cell-specific information
- May enable more personalized treatment approaches

Prevention and Treatment:
- Lifestyle interventions targeting multiple risk factors have shown significant benefits
- Studies show 18% reduction in fatal cardiovascular events with lifestyle modifications
- Key interventions include:
  - Diet modifications
  - Regular exercise
  - Smoking cessation
  - Blood pressure control
  - Diabetes management
  
The research emphasizes that while non-modifiable risk factors play a major role, controlling modifiable risk factors through lifestyle interventions and proper medical management can substantially reduce CAD events and improve outcomes. Early detection and prevention remain critical strategies.

Methodology:
Based on the provided content, here is a clean, formatted summary of the key points about coronary artery disease (CAD):

Overview:
- CAD is characterized by atherosclerotic plaque buildup in coronary arteries that impedes blood flow to the heart
- It is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, particularly affecting low and middle-income countries
- CAD results in inadequate oxygen supply to heart muscle due to coronary artery obstruction

Key Risk Factors:
- Non-modifiable: Age, gender, family history, genetics
- Modifiable: Hypertension, smoking, obesity, abnormal lipid levels, diabetes
- Men are more predisposed than women
- Waist circumference is an important indicator, even with normal BMI

Diagnosis:
- Key diagnostic tools include:
  - Electrocardiogram (ECG)
  - Echocardiography
  - Stress testing
  - Cardiac catheterization (gold standard)
  - Coronary calcium scoring
  - Blood tests for cardiac enzymes and other markers

Treatment Approaches:
- Treatment depends on whether condition is stable or acute
- Stable disease management includes:
  - Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, smoking cessation)
  - Medications (aspirin, statins, beta-blockers)
  - May require interventional procedures in some cases
- Acute coronary syndrome requires emergency care with:
  - Immediate medications
  - Possible emergency procedures
  - Close monitoring

The disease requires ongoing management through regular medical visits, medication adherence, and lifestyle modifications. Outcomes depend on multiple factors including age, comorbidities, and adherence to treatment plans.

Here is a clean, formatted summary of the key points from the provided content:

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Overview:
- Leading cause of mortality in the United States, accounting for approximately 610,000 deaths annually (1 in 4 deaths)
- Third leading cause of mortality worldwide with 17.8 million deaths annually
- Healthcare costs exceed $200 billion annually in the US
- While serious, CAD is largely preventable

Risk Factors:
Non-modifiable:
- Age
- Gender
- Ethnicity
- Family history

Modifiable:
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Smoking
- Poor diet
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Stress

Prevention and Treatment:
- Early screening and identification of risk factors is crucial
- Team-based care approach involving clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and nutritionists
- Focus on lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise
- Medication management for conditions like hypertension and diabetes
- Regular monitoring of blood pressure and weight
- Patient education about risk factors and prevention strategies

Progress:
- Risk factor identification and medical advances have significantly decreased CAD mortality rates over the past 40 years in Western countries
- Projections show continued decline in heart disease deaths for both men and women
- Optimal management of modifiable risk factors can lead to substantial reductions in CAD events
- Preventive care before and between acute events accounts for approximately 90% of potential benefits in perfect care scenarios

The data emphasizes that while CAD remains a major health concern, it can be effectively prevented and managed through comprehensive risk factor modification and team-based healthcare approaches.

Discussion:
Here's a coherent plain-text summary combining the key points from those sources about coronary artery disease (CAD):

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 610,000 deaths annually in the US alone. However, significant advances have been made in treatment approaches over the past decade through various scientific and technological innovations:

Key Treatment Advances:

1. Robotics & Surgery:
- Robot-assisted surgeries provide improved precision, visibility, and reduced radiation exposure
- Used for procedures like bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary interventions
- Can lead to shorter hospital stays and improved patient recovery

2. Nanotechnology:
- Enables targeted drug delivery and improved stent designs
- Helps promote vessel healing and reduce restenosis
- Allows for controlled release of medications
- Shows promise in gene therapy applications

3. Stem Cell Therapy:
- Aims to repair damaged heart tissue and improve blood supply
- Various types studied including:
  - Bone marrow-derived cells
  - Adipose-derived cells
  - Cardiac stem cells
  - Induced pluripotent stem cells
- Early clinical trials show promising results for improving heart function

4. Other Innovations:
- 3D printing for surgical planning and education
- Novel drug developments including:
  - New anticoagulants
  - PCSK9 inhibitors for cholesterol management
  - Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors

While many of these approaches show promise, further clinical trials and long-term studies are needed before widespread adoption. The collaborative efforts between researchers, clinicians, and biomedical engineers continue to advance treatment options for CAD patients.

Risk factor management and early intervention remain crucial, with both modifiable factors (like hypertension, diabetes, and lifestyle) and non-modifiable factors (age, gender, genetics) playing important roles in disease progression and treatment outcomes.
